Abstract
We survey 146 papers analyzing “bias” in
NLP systems, fnding that their motivations
are often vague, inconsistent, and lacking
in normative reasoning, despite the fact that
analyzing “bias” is an inherently normative
process. We further fnd that these papers’
proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias” are poorly matched to
their motivations and do not engage with the
relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on
these fndings, we describe the beginnings of a
path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing “bias”
in NLP systems. These recommendations rest
on a greater recognition of the relationships
between language and social hierarchies,
encouraging researchers and practitioners
to articulate their conceptualizations of
“bias”—i.e., what kinds of system behaviors
are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why,
as well as the normative reasoning underlying
these statements—and to center work around
the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations
between technologists and such communities.

1 Introduction
A large body of work analyzing “bias” in natural
language processing (NLP) systems has emerged
in recent years, including work on “bias” in embedding spaces (e.g., Bolukbasi et al., 2016a; Caliskan
et al., 2017; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019; May
et al., 2019) as well as work on “bias” in systems
developed for a breadth of tasks including language
modeling (Lu et al., 2018; Bordia and Bowman,

2019), coreference resolution (Rudinger et al.,
2018; Zhao et al., 2018a), machine translation (Vanmassenhove et al., 2018; Stanovsky et al., 2019),
sentiment analysis (Kiritchenko and Mohammad,
2018), and hate speech/toxicity detection (e.g.,
Park et al., 2018; Dixon et al., 2018), among others.
Although these papers have laid vital groundwork by illustrating some of the ways that NLP
systems can be harmful, the majority of them fail
to engage critically with what constitutes “bias”
in the frst place. Despite the fact that analyzing
“bias” is an inherently normative process—in
which some system behaviors are deemed good
and others harmful—papers on “bias” in NLP
systems are rife with unstated assumptions about
what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in
what ways, to whom, and why. Indeed, the term
“bias” (or “gender bias” or “racial bias”) is used
to describe a wide range of system behaviors, even
though they may be harmful in different ways, to
different groups, or for different reasons. Even
papers analyzing “bias” in NLP systems developed
for the same task often conceptualize it differently.
For example, the following system behaviors
are all understood to be self-evident statements of
“racial bias”: (a) embedding spaces in which embeddings for names associated with African Americans
are closer (compared to names associated with
European Americans) to unpleasant words than
pleasant words (Caliskan et al., 2017); (b) sentiment analysis systems yielding different intensity
scores for sentences containing names associated
with African Americans and sentences containing
names associated with European Americans (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018); and (c) toxicity

detection systems scoring tweets containing features associated with African-American English as
more offensive than tweets without these features
(Davidson et al., 2019; Sap et al., 2019). Moreover,
some of these papers focus on “racial bias”
expressed in written text, while others focus on
“racial bias” against authors. This use of imprecise
terminology obscures these important differences.
We survey 146 papers analyzing “bias” in NLP
systems, fnding that their motivations are often
vague and inconsistent. Many lack any normative
reasoning for why the system behaviors that are
described as “bias” are harmful, in what ways, and
to whom. Moreover, the vast majority of these
papers do not engage with the relevant literature
outside of NLP to ground normative concerns when
proposing quantitative techniques for measuring
or mitigating “bias.” As a result, we fnd that many
of these techniques are poorly matched to their
motivations, and are not comparable to one another.
We then describe the beginnings of a path
forward by proposing three recommendations
that should guide work analyzing “bias” in NLP
systems. We argue that such work should examine
the relationships between language and social hierarchies; we call on researchers and practitioners
conducting such work to articulate their conceptualizations of “bias” in order to enable conversations
about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful,
in what ways, to whom, and why; and we recommend deeper engagements between technologists
and communities affected by NLP systems. We
also provide several concrete research questions
that are implied by each of our recommendations.

2 Method
Our survey includes all papers known to us
analyzing “bias” in NLP systems—146 papers in
total. We omitted papers about speech, restricting
our survey to papers about written text only. To
identify the 146 papers, we frst searched the ACL
Anthology1 for all papers with the keywords “bias”
or “fairness” that were made available prior to May
2020. We retained all papers about social “bias,”
and discarded all papers about other defnitions of
the keywords (e.g., hypothesis-only bias, inductive
bias, media bias). We also discarded all papers using “bias” in NLP systems to measure social “bias”
in text or the real world (e.g., Garg et al., 2018).

papers without the keywords “bias” or “fairness,”
we also traversed the citation graph of our initial
set of papers, retaining any papers analyzing “bias”
in NLP systems that are cited by or cite the papers
in our initial set. Finally, we manually inspected
any papers analyzing “bias” in NLP systems from
leading machine learning, human–computer interaction, and web conferences and workshops, such
as ICML, NeurIPS, AIES, FAccT, CHI, and WWW,
along with any relevant papers that were made
available in the “Computation and Language” and
“Computers and Society” categories on arXiv prior
to May 2020, but found that they had already been
identifed via our traversal of the citation graph. We
provide a list of all 146 papers in the appendix. In
Table 1, we provide a breakdown of the NLP tasks
covered by the papers. We note that counts do not
sum to 146, because some papers cover multiple
tasks. For example, a paper might test the effcacy
of a technique for mitigating “bias” in embedding spaces in the context of sentiment analysis.
Once identifed, we then read each of the 146 papers with the goal of categorizing their motivations
and their proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias.” We used a previously
developed taxonomy of harms for this categorization, which differentiates between so-called allocational and representational harms (Barocas et al.,
2017; Crawford, 2017). Allocational harms arise
when an automated system allocates resources (e.g.,
credit) or opportunities (e.g., jobs) unfairly to different social groups; representational harms arise
when a system (e.g., a search engine) represents
some social groups in a less favorable light than
others, demeans them, or fails to recognize their
existence altogether. Adapting and extending this
taxonomy, we categorized the 146 papers’ motivations and techniques into the following categories:
. Allocational harms.

Table 2: The categories into which the 146 papers fall.

. Representational harms:2
. Stereotyping that propagates negative generalizations about particular social groups.
. Differences in system performance for different social groups, language that misrepresents the distribution of different social
groups in the population, or language that
is denigrating to particular social groups.
. Questionable correlations between system behavior and features of language that are typically associated with particular social groups.
. Vague descriptions of “bias” (or “gender
bias” or “racial bias”) or no description at all.
. Surveys, frameworks, and meta-analyses.
In Table 2 we provide counts for each of the
six categories listed above. (We also provide a
list of the papers that fall into each category in the
appendix.) Again, we note that the counts do not
sum to 146, because some papers state multiple
motivations, propose multiple techniques, or propose a single technique for measuring or mitigating
multiple harms. Table 3, which is in the appendix,
contains examples of the papers’ motivations and
techniques across a range of different NLP tasks.

Papers state a wide range of motivations,
multiple motivations, vague motivations, and
sometimes no motivations at all. We found that
the papers’ motivations span all six categories, with
several papers falling into each one. Appropriately,
papers that provide surveys or frameworks for analyzing “bias” in NLP systems often state multiple
motivations (e.g., Hovy and Spruit, 2016; Bender,
2019; Sun et al., 2019; Rozado, 2020; Shah et al.,
2020). However, as the examples in Table 3 (in the
appendix) illustrate, many other papers (33%) do
so as well. Some papers (16%) state only vague
motivations or no motivations at all. For example,
“[N]o human should be discriminated on the basis
of demographic attributes by an NLP system.”
—Kaneko and Bollegala (2019)
“[P]rominent word embeddings [...] encode
systematic biases against women and black people
[...] implicating many NLP systems in scaling up
social injustice.”
—May et al. (2019)

These examples leave unstated what it might mean
for an NLP system to “discriminate,” what constitutes “systematic biases,” or how NLP systems
contribute to “social injustice” (itself undefned).
Papers’ motivations sometimes include no normative reasoning. We found that some papers
(32%) are not motivated by any apparent normative
concerns, often focusing instead on concerns about
system performance. For example, the frst quote
below includes normative reasoning—namely that
models should not use demographic information
to make predictions—while the other focuses on
learned correlations impairing system performance.
“In [text classifcation], models are expected to
make predictions with the semantic information
rather than with the demographic group identity
information (e.g., ‘gay’, ‘black’) contained in the
sentences.”
—Zhang et al. (2020a)

3 Findings
Categorizing the 146 papers’ motivations and proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias” into the six categories listed above enabled us to identify several commonalities, which
we present below, along with illustrative quotes.

We grouped several types of representational harms into
two categories to refect that the main point of differentiation
between the 146 papers’ motivations and proposed quantitative
techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias” is whether or not
they focus on stereotyping. Among the papers that do not focus on stereotyping, we found that most lack suffciently clear
motivations and techniques to reliably categorize them further.

Motivations

“An over-prevalence of some gendered forms in the
training data leads to translations with identifable
errors. Translations are better for sentences
involving men and for sentences containing
stereotypical gender roles.”
—Saunders and Byrne (2020)

Even when papers do state clear motivations,
they are often unclear about why the system behaviors that are described as “bias” are harmful, in what ways, and to whom. We found that
even papers with clear motivations often fail to explain what kinds of system behaviors are harmful,
in what ways, to whom, and why. For example,

“Deploying these word embedding algorithms in
practice, for example in automated translation
systems or as hiring aids, runs the serious risk of
perpetuating problematic biases in important
societal contexts.”
—Brunet et al. (2019)

“It is essential to quantify and mitigate gender bias
in these embeddings to avoid them from affecting
downstream applications.”
—Zhou et al. (2019)

“[I]f the systems show discriminatory behaviors in
the interactions, the user experience will be
adversely affected.”
—Liu et al. (2019)

These examples leave unstated what “problematic
biases” or non-ideal user experiences might look
like, how the system behaviors might result in
these things, and who the relevant stakeholders
or users might be. In contrast, we fnd that papers
that provide surveys or frameworks for analyzing
“bias” in NLP systems often name who is harmed,
acknowledging that different social groups may
experience these systems differently due to their
different relationships with NLP systems or
different social positions. For example, Ruane
et al. (2019) argue for a “deep understanding of
the user groups [sic] characteristics, contexts, and
interests” when designing conversational agents.
Papers about NLP systems developed for the
same task often conceptualize “bias” differently. Even papers that cover the same NLP task
often conceptualize “bias” in ways that differ substantially and are sometimes inconsistent. Rows 3
and 4 of Table 3 (in the appendix) contain machine
translation papers with different conceptualizations
of “bias,” leading to different proposed techniques,
while rows 5 and 6 contain papers on “bias” in embedding spaces that state different motivations, but
propose techniques for quantifying stereotyping.
Papers’ motivations confate allocational and
representational harms. We found that the papers’ motivations sometimes (16%) name immediate representational harms, such as stereotyping,
alongside more distant allocational harms, which,
in the case of stereotyping, are usually imagined as
downstream effects of stereotypes on résumé fltering. Many of these papers use the imagined downstream effects to justify focusing on particular system behaviors, even when the downstream effects
are not measured. Papers on “bias” in embedding
spaces are especially likely to do this because embeddings are often used as input to other systems:
“However, none of these papers [on embeddings]
have recognized how blatantly sexist the
embeddings are and hence risk introducing biases
of various types into real-world systems.”
—Bolukbasi et al. (2016a)

In contrast, papers that provide surveys or frameworks for analyzing “bias” in NLP systems treat
representational harms as harmful in their own
right. For example, Mayfeld et al. (2019) and
Ruane et al. (2019) cite the harmful reproduction
of dominant linguistic norms by NLP systems (a
point to which we return in section 4), while Bender
(2019) outlines a range of harms, including seeing
stereotypes in search results and being made invisible to search engines due to language practices.
3.2

Techniques

Papers’ techniques are not well grounded in the
relevant literature outside of NLP. Perhaps unsurprisingly given that the papers’ motivations are
often vague, inconsistent, and lacking in normative
reasoning, we also found that the papers’ proposed
quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating
“bias” do not effectively engage with the relevant
literature outside of NLP. Papers on stereotyping
are a notable exception: the Word Embedding
Association Test (Caliskan et al., 2017) draws on
the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al.,
1998) from the social psychology literature, while
several techniques operationalize the well-studied
“Angry Black Woman” stereotype (Kiritchenko
and Mohammad, 2018; May et al., 2019; Tan
and Celis, 2019) and the “double bind” faced by
women (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), in
which women who succeed at stereotypically male
tasks are perceived to be less likable than similarly
successful men (Heilman et al., 2004). Tan and
Celis (2019) also examine the compounding effects
of race and gender, drawing on Black feminist
scholarship on intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989).
Papers’ techniques are poorly matched to their
motivations. We found that although 21% of the
papers include allocational harms in their motivations, only four papers actually propose techniques
for measuring or mitigating allocational harms.
Papers focus on a narrow range of potential
sources of “bias.” We found that nearly all of the
papers focus on system predictions as the potential
sources of “bias,” with many additionally focusing
on “bias” in datasets (e.g., differences in the
number of gendered pronouns in the training data
(Zhao et al., 2019)). Most papers do not interrogate

the normative implications of other decisions made
during the development and deployment lifecycle—
perhaps unsurprising given that their motivations
sometimes include no normative reasoning. A
few papers are exceptions, illustrating the impacts
of task defnitions, annotation guidelines, and
evaluation metrics: Cao and Daumé (2019) study
how folk conceptions of gender (Keyes, 2018) are
reproduced in coreference resolution systems that
assume a strict gender dichotomy, thereby maintaining cisnormativity; Sap et al. (2019) focus on
the effect of priming annotators with information
about possible dialectal differences when asking
them to apply toxicity labels to sample tweets, fnding that annotators who are primed are signifcantly
less likely to label tweets containing features associated with African-American English as offensive.

4 A path forward
We now describe how researchers and practitioners
conducting work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems
might avoid the pitfalls presented in the previous
section—the beginnings of a path forward. We
propose three recommendations that should guide
such work, and, for each, provide several concrete
research questions. We emphasize that these questions are not comprehensive, and are intended to
generate further questions and lines of engagement.
Our three recommendations are as follows:
(R1) Ground work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems in the relevant literature outside of NLP
that explores the relationships between language and social hierarchies. Treat representational harms as harmful in their own right.
(R2) Provide explicit statements of why the
system behaviors that are described as “bias”
are harmful, in what ways, and to whom.
Be forthright about the normative reasoning
(Green, 2019) underlying these statements.
(R3) Examine language use in practice by engaging with the lived experiences of members of
communities affected by NLP systems. Interrogate and reimagine the power relations between technologists and such communities.
4.1

Language and social hierarchies

Turning frst to (R1), we argue that work analyzing
“bias” in NLP systems will paint a much fuller picture if it engages with the relevant literature outside
of NLP that explores the relationships between

language and social hierarchies. Many disciplines,
including sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology,
sociology, and social psychology, study how
language takes on social meaning and the role that
language plays in maintaining social hierarchies.
For example, language is the means through which
social groups are labeled and one way that beliefs
about social groups are transmitted (e.g., Maass,
1999; Beukeboom and Burgers, 2019). Group
labels can serve as the basis of stereotypes and thus
reinforce social inequalities: “[T]he label content
functions to identify a given category of people,
and thereby conveys category boundaries and a
position in a hierarchical taxonomy” (Beukeboom
and Burgers, 2019). Similarly, “controlling
images,” such as stereotypes of Black women,
which are linguistically and visually transmitted
through literature, news media, television, and so
forth, provide “ideological justifcation” for their
continued oppression (Collins, 2000, Chapter 4).
As a result, many groups have sought to bring
about social changes through changes in language,
disrupting patterns of oppression and marginalization via so-called “gender-fair” language
(Sczesny et al., 2016; Menegatti and Rubini, 2017),
language that is more inclusive to people with
disabilities (ADA, 2018), and language that is less
dehumanizing (e.g., abandoning the use of the term
“illegal” in everyday discourse on immigration in
the U.S. (Rosa, 2019)). The fact that group labels
are so contested is evidence of how deeply intertwined language and social hierarchies are. Taking
“gender-fair” language as an example, the hope
is that reducing asymmetries in language about
women and men will reduce asymmetries in their
social standing. Meanwhile, struggles over language use often arise from dominant social groups’
desire to “control both material and symbolic
resources”—i.e., “the right to decide what words
will mean and to control those meanings”—as was
the case in some white speakers’ insistence on
using offensive place names against the objections
of Indigenous speakers (Hill, 2008, Chapter 3).
Sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists
have also examined language attitudes and language ideologies, or people’s metalinguistic beliefs
about language: Which language varieties or practices are taken as standard, ordinary, or unmarked?
Which are considered correct, prestigious, or appropriate for public use, and which are considered
incorrect, uneducated, or offensive (e.g., CampbellKibler, 2009; Preston, 2009; Loudermilk, 2015;
Lanehart and Malik, 2018)? Which are rendered invisible (Roche, 2019)?3 Language ideologies play
a vital role in reinforcing and justifying social hierarchies because beliefs about language varieties
or practices often translate into beliefs about their
speakers (e.g. Alim et al., 2016; Rosa and Flores,
2017; Craft et al., 2020). For example, in the U.S.,
the portrayal of non-white speakers’ language
varieties and practices as linguistically defcient
helped to justify violent European colonialism, and
today continues to justify enduring racial hierarchies by maintaining views of non-white speakers
as lacking the language “required for complex
thinking processes and successful engagement
in the global economy” (Rosa and Flores, 2017).
Recognizing the role that language plays in
maintaining social hierarchies is critical to the
future of work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems.
First, it helps to explain why representational
harms are harmful in their own right. Second, the
complexity of the relationships between language
and social hierarchies illustrates why studying
“bias” in NLP systems is so challenging, suggesting
that researchers and practitioners will need to move
beyond existing algorithmic fairness techniques.
We argue that work must be grounded in the
relevant literature outside of NLP that examines
the relationships between language and social
hierarchies; without this grounding, researchers
and practitioners risk measuring or mitigating
only what is convenient to measure or mitigate,
rather than what is most normatively concerning.
More specifcally, we recommend that work
analyzing “bias” in NLP systems be reoriented
around the following question: How are social
hierarchies, language ideologies, and NLP systems
coproduced? This question mirrors Benjamin’s
(2020) call to examine how “race and technology
are coproduced”—i.e., how racial hierarchies, and
the ideologies and discourses that maintain them,
create and are re-created by technology. We recommend that researchers and practitioners similarly
ask how existing social hierarchies and language
ideologies drive the development and deployment
of NLP systems, and how these systems therefore
reproduce these hierarchies and ideologies. As
a starting point for reorienting work analyzing
“bias” in NLP systems around this question, we

provide the following concrete research questions:

Language ideologies encompass much more than this; see,
e.g., Lippi-Green (2012), Alim et al. (2016), Rosa and Flores
(2017), Rosa and Burdick (2017), and Charity Hudley (2017).

. How do social hierarchies and language
ideologies infuence the decisions made during
the development and deployment lifecycle?
What kinds of NLP systems do these decisions
result in, and what kinds do they foreclose?
 General assumptions: To which linguistic
norms do NLP systems adhere (Bender,
2019; Ruane et al., 2019)? Which language
practices are implicitly assumed to be
standard, ordinary, correct, or appropriate?
 Task defnition: For which speakers
are NLP systems (and NLP resources)
developed? (See Joshi et al. (2020) for
a discussion.) How do task defnitions
discretize the world? For example, how
are social groups delineated when defning
demographic attribute prediction tasks
(e.g., Koppel et al., 2002; Rosenthal and
McKeown, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2013)?
What about languages in native language
prediction tasks (Tetreault et al., 2013)?
 Data: How are datasets collected, preprocessed, and labeled or annotated? What are
the impacts of annotation guidelines, annotator assumptions and perceptions (Olteanu
et al., 2019; Sap et al., 2019; Geiger et al.,
2020), and annotation aggregation processes (Pavlick and Kwiatkowski, 2019)?
 Evaluation: How are NLP systems evaluated? What are the impacts of evaluation
metrics (Olteanu et al., 2017)? Are any
non-quantitative evaluations performed?
. How do NLP systems reproduce or transform
language ideologies? Which language varieties
or practices come to be deemed good or bad?
Might “good” language simply mean language
that is easily handled by existing NLP systems? For example, linguistic phenomena arising from many language practices (Eisenstein,
2013) are described as “noisy text” and often
viewed as a target for “normalization.” How
do the language ideologies that are reproduced
by NLP systems maintain social hierarchies?
. Which representational harms are being
measured or mitigated? Are these the most
normatively concerning harms, or merely
those that are well handled by existing algorithmic fairness techniques? Are there other
representational harms that might be analyzed?

4.2

Conceptualizations of “bias”

underpin this conceptualization of “bias?”

Turning now to (R2), we argue that work analyzing
“bias” in NLP systems should provide explicit
statements of why the system behaviors that are
described as “bias” are harmful, in what ways,
and to whom, as well as the normative reasoning
underlying these statements. In other words,
researchers and practitioners should articulate their
conceptualizations of “bias.” As we described
above, papers often contain descriptions of system
behaviors that are understood to be self-evident
statements of “bias.” This use of imprecise
terminology has led to papers all claiming to
analyze “bias” in NLP systems, sometimes even
in systems developed for the same task, but with
different or even inconsistent conceptualizations of
“bias,” and no explanations for these differences.
Yet analyzing “bias” is an inherently normative
process—in which some system behaviors are
deemed good and others harmful—even if assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are
harmful, in what ways, for whom, and why are
not stated. We therefore echo calls by Bardzell and
Bardzell (2011), Keyes et al. (2019), and Green
(2019) for researchers and practitioners to make
their normative reasoning explicit by articulating
the social values that underpin their decisions to
deem some system behaviors as harmful, no matter
how obvious such values appear to be. We further
argue that this reasoning should take into account
the relationships between language and social
hierarchies that we described above. First, these
relationships provide a foundation from which to
approach the normative reasoning that we recommend making explicit. For example, some system
behaviors might be harmful precisely because
they maintain social hierarchies. Second, if work
analyzing “bias” in NLP systems is reoriented
to understand how social hierarchies, language
ideologies, and NLP systems are coproduced, then
this work will be incomplete if we fail to account
for the ways that social hierarchies and language
ideologies determine what we mean by “bias” in
the frst place. As a starting point, we therefore
provide the following concrete research questions:
. What kinds of system behaviors are described
as “bias”? What are their potential sources (e.g.,
general assumptions, task defnition, data)?
. In what ways are these system behaviors harmful, to whom are they harmful, and why?
. What are the social values (obvious or not) that

4.3

Language use in practice

Finally, we turn to (R3). Our perspective, which
rests on a greater recognition of the relationships
between language and social hierarchies, suggests
several directions for examining language use in
practice. Here, we focus on two. First, because language is necessarily situated, and because different
social groups have different lived experiences due
to their different social positions (Hanna et al.,
2020)—particularly groups at the intersections
of multiple axes of oppression—we recommend
that researchers and practitioners center work
analyzing “bias” in NLP systems around the lived
experiences of members of communities affected
by these systems. Second, we recommend that
the power relations between technologists and
such communities be interrogated and reimagined.
Researchers have pointed out that algorithmic
fairness techniques, by proposing incremental
technical mitigations—e.g., collecting new datasets
or training better models—maintain these power
relations by (a) assuming that automated systems
should continue to exist, rather than asking
whether they should be built at all, and (b) keeping
development and deployment decisions in the
hands of technologists (Bennett and Keyes, 2019;
Cifor et al., 2019; Green, 2019; Katell et al., 2020).
There are many disciplines for researchers and
practitioners to draw on when pursuing these
directions. For example, in human–computer
interaction, Hamidi et al. (2018) study transgender
people’s experiences with automated gender
recognition systems in order to uncover how
these systems reproduce structures of transgender
exclusion by redefning what it means to perform
gender “normally.” Value-sensitive design provides
a framework for accounting for the values of different stakeholders in the design of technology (e.g.,
Friedman et al., 2006; Friedman and Hendry, 2019;
Le Dantec et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2019), while
participatory design seeks to involve stakeholders
in the design process itself (Sanders, 2002; Muller,
2007; Simonsen and Robertson, 2013; DiSalvo
et al., 2013). Participatory action research in education (Kemmis, 2006) and in language documentation and reclamation (Junker, 2018) is also relevant.
In particular, work on language reclamation to
support decolonization and tribal sovereignty
(Leonard, 2012) and work in sociolinguistics focusing on developing co-equal research relationships
with community members and supporting linguistic justice efforts (e.g., Bucholtz et al., 2014, 2016,
2019) provide examples of more emancipatory relationships with communities. Finally, several workshops and events have begun to explore how to empower stakeholders in the development and deployment of technology (Vaccaro et al., 2019; Givens
and Morris, 2020; Sassaman et al., 2020)4 and how
to help researchers and practitioners consider when
not to build systems at all (Barocas et al., 2020).
As a starting point for engaging with communities affected by NLP systems, we therefore
provide the following concrete research questions:
. How do communities become aware of NLP
systems? Do they resist them, and if so, how?
. What additional costs are borne by communities for whom NLP systems do not work well?
. Do NLP systems shift power toward oppressive
institutions (e.g., by enabling predictions that
communities do not want made, linguistically
based unfair allocation of resources or opportunities (Rosa and Flores, 2017), surveillance,
or censorship), or away from such institutions?
. Who is involved in the development and
deployment of NLP systems?
How do
decision-making processes maintain power relations between technologists and communities
affected by NLP systems? Can these processes be changed to reimagine these relations?

5 Case study
To illustrate our recommendations, we present a
case study covering work on African-American
English (AAE).5 Work analyzing “bias” in the context of AAE has shown that part-of-speech taggers,
language identifcation systems, and dependency
parsers all work less well on text containing
features associated with AAE than on text without
these features (Jørgensen et al., 2015, 2016; Blodgett et al., 2016, 2018), and that toxicity detection
systems score tweets containing features associated
with AAE as more offensive than tweets without them (Davidson et al., 2019; Sap et al., 2019).
These papers have been critical for highlighting
AAE as a language variety for which existing NLP

Also https://participatoryml.github.io/
This language variety has had many different names
over the years, but is now generally called AfricanAmerican English (AAE), African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), or African-American Language (AAL) (Green,
2002; Wolfram and Schilling, 2015; Rickford and King, 2016).

systems may not work, illustrating their limitations.
However, they do not conceptualize “racial bias” in
the same way. The frst four of these papers simply
focus on system performance differences between
text containing features associated with AAE and
text without these features. In contrast, the last
two papers also focus on such system performance
differences, but motivate this focus with the following additional reasoning: If tweets containing
features associated with AAE are scored as more
offensive than tweets without these features, then
this might (a) yield negative perceptions of AAE;
(b) result in disproportionate removal of tweets
containing these features, impeding participation
in online platforms and reducing the space available online in which speakers can use AAE freely;
and (c) cause AAE speakers to incur additional
costs if they have to change their language practices
to avoid negative perceptions or tweet removal.
More importantly, none of these papers engage
with the literature on AAE, racial hierarchies in the
U.S., and raciolinguistic ideologies. By failing to
engage with this literature—thereby treating AAE
simply as one of many non-Penn Treebank varieties of English or perhaps as another challenging
domain—work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems
in the context of AAE fails to situate these systems
in the world. Who are the speakers of AAE? How
are they viewed? We argue that AAE as a language
variety cannot be separated from its speakers—
primarily Black people in the U.S., who experience
systemic anti-Black racism—and the language ideologies that reinforce and justify racial hierarchies.
Even after decades of sociolinguistic efforts to
legitimize AAE, it continues to be viewed as “bad”
English and its speakers continue to be viewed as
linguistically inadequate—a view called the defcit
perspective (Alim et al., 2016; Rosa and Flores,
2017). This perspective persists despite demonstrations that AAE is rule-bound and grammatical
(Mufwene et al., 1998; Green, 2002), in addition
to ample evidence of its speakers’ linguistic adroitness (e.g., Alim, 2004; Rickford and King, 2016).
This perspective belongs to a broader set of raciolinguistic ideologies (Rosa and Flores, 2017), which
also produce allocational harms; speakers of AAE
are frequently penalized for not adhering to dominant language practices, including in the education
system (Alim, 2004; Terry et al., 2010), when
seeking housing (Baugh, 2018), and in the judicial
system, where their testimony is misunderstood or,

worse yet, disbelieved (Rickford and King, 2016;
Jones et al., 2019). These raciolinguistic ideologies
position racialized communities as needing
linguistic intervention, such as language education
programs, in which these and other harms can be
reduced if communities accommodate to dominant language practices (Rosa and Flores, 2017).
In the technology industry, speakers of AAE are
often not considered consumers who matter. For
example, Benjamin (2019) recounts an Apple employee who worked on speech recognition for Siri:
“As they worked on different English dialects —
Australian, Singaporean, and Indian English — [the
employee] asked his boss: ‘What about African
American English?’ To this his boss responded:
‘Well, Apple products are for the premium market.”’

The reality, of course, is that speakers of AAE tend
not to represent the “premium market” precisely because of institutions and policies that help to maintain racial hierarchies by systematically denying
them the opportunities to develop wealth that are
available to white Americans (Rothstein, 2017)—
an exclusion that is reproduced in technology by
countless decisions like the one described above.
Engaging with the literature outlined above
situates the system behaviors that are described
as “bias,” providing a foundation for normative
reasoning. Researchers and practitioners should
be concerned about “racial bias” in toxicity
detection systems not only because performance
differences impair system performance, but
because they reproduce longstanding injustices of
stigmatization and disenfranchisement for speakers
of AAE. In re-stigmatizing AAE, they reproduce
language ideologies in which AAE is viewed as
ungrammatical, uneducated, and offensive. These
ideologies, in turn, enable linguistic discrimination
and justify enduring racial hierarchies (Rosa and
Flores, 2017). Our perspective, which understands
racial hierarchies and raciolinguistic ideologies as
structural conditions that govern the development
and deployment of technology, implies that
techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias”
in NLP systems will necessarily be incomplete
unless they interrogate and dismantle these
structural conditions, including the power relations
between technologists and racialized communities.
We emphasize that engaging with the literature
on AAE, racial hierarchies in the U.S., and
raciolinguistic ideologies can generate new lines of
engagement. These lines include work on the ways
that the decisions made during the development

and deployment of NLP systems produce stigmatization and disenfranchisement, and work on AAE
use in practice, such as the ways that speakers
of AAE interact with NLP systems that were not
designed for them. This literature can also help researchers and practitioners address the allocational
harms that may be produced by NLP systems, and
ensure that even well-intentioned NLP systems
do not position racialized communities as needing
linguistic intervention or accommodation to
dominant language practices. Finally, researchers
and practitioners wishing to design better systems
can also draw on a growing body of work on
anti-racist language pedagogy that challenges the
defcit perspective of AAE and other racialized
language practices (e.g. Flores and Chaparro, 2018;
Baker-Bell, 2019; Martínez and Mejía, 2019), as
well as the work that we described in section 4.3
on reimagining the power relations between technologists and communities affected by technology.

Conclusion

By surveying 146 papers analyzing “bias” in NLP
systems, we found that (a) their motivations are
often vague, inconsistent, and lacking in normative reasoning; and (b) their proposed quantitative
techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias” are
poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage with the relevant literature outside of NLP.
To help researchers and practitioners avoid these
pitfalls, we proposed three recommendations that
should guide work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems, and, for each, provided several concrete research questions. These recommendations rest on
a greater recognition of the relationships between
language and social hierarchies—a step that we
see as paramount to establishing a path forward.

A Appendix
In Table 3, we provide examples of the papers’ motivations and techniques across several NLP tasks.
A.1

Categorization details

In this section, we provide some additional details
about our method—specifcally, our categorization.
What counts as being covered by an NLP task?
We considered a paper to cover a given NLP task if
it analyzed “bias” with respect to that task, but not
if it only evaluated overall performance on that task.
For example, a paper examining the impact of mitigating “bias” in word embeddings on “bias” in sentiment analysis would be counted as covering both
NLP tasks. In contrast, a paper assessing whether
performance on sentiment analysis degraded after
mitigating “bias” in word embeddings would be
counted only as focusing on embeddings.
What counts as a motivation? We considered a
motivation to include any description of the problem that motivated the paper or proposed quantitative technique, including any normative reasoning.
We excluded from the “Vague/unstated” category of motivations the papers that participated in
the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun (GAP) Shared
Task at the First ACL Workshop on Gender Bias in
NLP. In an ideal world, shared task papers would
engage with “bias” more critically, but given the
nature of shared tasks it is understandable that they

do not. As a result, we excluded them from our
counts for techniques as well. We cite the papers
here; most propose techniques we would have categorized as “Questionable correlations,” with a few
as “Other representational harms” (Abzaliev, 2019;
Attree, 2019; Bao and Qiao, 2019; Chada, 2019;
Ionita et al., 2019; Liu, 2019; Lois et al., 2019;
Wang, 2019; Xu and Yang, 2019; Yang et al., 2019).
We excluded Dabas et al. (2020) from our survey
because we could not determine what this paper’s
user study on fairness was actually measuring.
Finally, we actually categorized the motivation
for Liu et al. (2019) (i.e., the last row in Table 3) as
“Questionable correlations” due to a sentence elsewhere in the paper; had the paragraph we quoted
been presented without more detail, we would have
categorized the motivation as “Vague/unstated.”

Language
modeling
(Bordia and
Bowman,
2019)

“Existing biases in data can be amplifed by models and the
resulting output consumed by the public can infuence them, encourage and reinforce harmful stereotypes, or distort the truth.
Automated systems that depend on these models can take problematic actions based on biased profling of individuals.”

Allocational

Questionable

Sentiment
analysis
(Kiritchenko
and
Mohammad,
2018)

“Other biases can be inappropriate and result in negative experiences for some groups of people. Examples include, loan
eligibility and crime recidivism prediction systems...and resumé
sorting systems that believe that men are more qualifed to be
programmers than women (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Similarly,
sentiment and emotion analysis systems can also perpetuate and
accentuate inappropriate human biases, e.g., systems that consider
utterances from one race or gender to be less positive simply because of their race or gender, or customer support systems that
prioritize a call from an angry male over a call from the equally
angry female.”

Machine
translation
(Cho et al.,
2019)

“[MT training] may incur an association of gender-specifed pronouns (in the target) and gender-neutral ones (in the source) for
lexicon pairs that frequently collocate in the corpora. We claim
that this kind of phenomenon seriously threatens the fairness of a
translation system, in the sense that it lacks generality and inserts
social bias to the inference. Moreover, the input is not fully correct (considering gender-neutrality) and might offend the users
who expect fairer representations.”

Type-level
embeddings
(Zhao et al.,
2018b)

“However, embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have
been demonstrated to inherit strong gender stereotypes that refect social constructs....Such a bias substantially affects downstream applications....This concerns the practitioners who use
the embedding model to build gender-sensitive applications such
as a resume fltering system or a job recommendation system as
the automated system may discriminate candidates based on their
gender, as refected by their name. Besides, biased embeddings
may implicitly affect downstream applications used in our daily
lives. For example, when searching for ‘computer scientist’ using
a search engine...a search algorithm using an embedding model in
the backbone tends to rank male scientists higher than females’
[sic], hindering women from being recognized and further exacerbating the gender inequality in the community.”

Type-level
and contextualized
embeddings
(May et al.,
2019)

“[P]rominent word embeddings such as word2vec (Mikolov et
al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) encode systematic
biases against women and black people (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;
Garg et al., 2018), implicating many NLP systems in scaling up
social injustice.”

Vague

Stereotyping

Dialogue
generation
(Liu et al.,
2019)

“Since the goal of dialogue systems is to talk with users...if the
systems show discriminatory behaviors in the interactions, the
user experience will be adversely affected. Moreover, public commercial chatbots can get resisted for their improper speech.”
