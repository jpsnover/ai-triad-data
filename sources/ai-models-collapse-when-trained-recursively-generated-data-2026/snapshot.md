Stable diffusion revolutionized image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2 (ref.?1),
GPT-3(.5) (ref.?2) and GPT-4 (ref.?3) demonstrated high performance across a variety
of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now
clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs)
is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images.
Here we consider what may happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the text
found online. We find that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training
causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original
content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as æmodel collapseÆ and show
that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and
portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it
must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale
data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine
human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of
LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.

The development of LLMs is very involved and requires large quantities
of training data. Yet, although current LLMs2,4û6, including GPT-3, were
trained on predominantly human-generated text, this may change.
If the training data of most future models are also scraped from the
web, then they will inevitably train on data produced by their predeces-
sors. In this paper, we investigate what happens when text produced
by, for example, a version of GPT forms most of the training dataset
of following models. What happens to GPT generations GPT-{n} as
n increases? We discover that indiscriminately learning from data
produced by other models causes æmodel collapseÆùa degenerative
process whereby, over time, models forget the true underlying data
distribution, even in the absence of a shift in the distribution over time.
We give examples of model collapse for GMMs, VAEs and LLMs. We
show that, over time, models start losing information about the true
distribution, which first starts with tails disappearing, and learned
behaviours converge over the generations to a point estimate with very
small variance. Furthermore, we show that this process is inevitable,
even for cases with almost ideal conditions for long-term learning,
that is, no function estimation error. We also briefly mention two
close concepts to model collapse from the existing literature: cata-
strophic forgetting arising in the framework of task-free continual
learning7 and data poisoning8,9 maliciously leading to unintended
behaviour. Neither is able to explain the phenomenon of model col-
lapse fully, as the setting is fundamentally different, but they provide
another perspective on the observed phenomenon and are discussed
in more depth in theáSupplementary Materials. Finally, we discuss

the broader implications of model collapse. We note that access to
the original data distribution is crucial: in learning tasks in which the
tails of the underlying distribution matter, one needs access to real
human-produced data. In other words, the use of LLMs at scale to
publish content on the Internet will pollute the collection of data to
train their successors: data about human interactions with LLMs will
be increasingly valuable.

What is model collapse?
Definition 2.1 (model collapse). Model collapse is a degenerative
process affecting generations of learned generative models, in which
the data they generate end up polluting the training set of the next
generation. Being trained on polluted data, they then mis-perceive
reality. The process is depicted in Fig.á1a. We separate two special cases:
early model collapse and late model collapse. In early model collapse,
the model begins losing information about the tails of the distribu-
tion; in late model collapse, the model converges to a distribution that
carries little resemblance to the original one, often with substantially
reduced variance.

This process occurs owing to three specific sources of error com-
pounding over generations and causing deviation from the original
model:
ò  Statistical approximation error. This is the primary type of error,
which arises owing to the number of samples being finite, and disap-
pears as the number of samples tends to infinity. This occurs because

Perplexity of generated data points

Trained on dataset from a given generation

Fig. 1 | The high-level description of the feedback mechanism in the
learning process. a, Model collapse refers to a degenerative learning process
in which models start forgetting improbable events over time, as the model
becomes poisoned with its own projection of reality. Here data are assumed
to be human-curated and start off clean; then model 0 is trained and data are
sampled from it; at step n, data are added to the overall data from step n???1
and this combination is used to train model n. Data obtained with Monte Carlo
sampling should ideally be statistically close to the original, provided that
fitting and sampling procedures are perfect. This process depicts what
happens in real life with the Internet: model-generated data become pervasive.
b,c, Performance of OPT-125m models of different generations evaluated using
the original wikitext2 test dataset. Shown on the left are the histograms of
perplexities of each individual data training sequence produced by different
generations as evaluated by the very first model trained with the real data.

Over the generations, models tend to produce samples that the original model
trained with real data is more likely to produce. At the same time, a much longer
tail appears for later generations. Later generations start producing samples
that would never be produced by the original model, that is, they start
misperceiving reality based on errors introduced by their ancestors. The same
plots are shown in 3D in the Supplementary Materials. On the right, average
perplexity and its standard deviation are shown for each independent run. The
x axis refers to the generation of the model. æRealÆ refers to the æmodel 0Æ trained
on the original wikitext2 dataset; model 1 was trained on the data produced by
model 0, model 2 was trained on data produced by model 1 and so on, with all
generated datasets equal in size. We find that models trained on generated
data are able to learn some of the original task, but with errors, as seen from the
increase in perplexity.

of a non-zero probability that information can get lost at every step
of resampling.

ò  Functional expressivity error. This is a secondary type of error,
arising owing to limited function approximator expressiveness. In
particular, neural networks are only universal approximators as their
size goes to infinity. As a result, a neural network can introduce non-
zero likelihood outside the support of the original distribution or zero
likelihood inside the support of the original distribution. A simple
example of the expressivity error is if we tried fitting a mixture of two
Gaussians with a single Gaussian. Even if we have perfect information
about the data distribution (that is, infinite number of samples),
model errors will be inevitable. However, in the absence of the other
two types of error, this can only occur at the first generation.

ò  Functional approximation error. This is a secondary type of error,
arising primarily from the limitations of learning procedures, for

example, structural bias of stochastic gradient descent10,11 or choice
of objective12. This error can be viewed as one arising in the limit of
infinite data and perfect expressivity at each generation.
Each of the above can cause model collapse to get worse or better.
More approximation power can even be a double-edged swordùbetter
expressiveness may counteract statistical noise, resulting in a good
approximation of the true distribution, but it can equally compound
the noise. More often than not, we get a cascading effect, in which indi-
vidual inaccuracies combine to cause the overall error to grow. For
example, overfitting the density model causes the model to extrapolate
incorrectly and assigns high-density regions to low-density regions
not covered in the training set support; these will then be sampled
with arbitrary frequency. It is worth noting that other types of error
exist. For example, computers have limited precision in practice. We
now turn to mathematical intuition to explain how the above give rise

to the errors observed, how different sources can compound and how
we can quantify the average model divergence.

Theoretical intuition
Here we provide a theoretical intuition for the phenomenon of model
collapse. We argue that the process of model collapse is universal
among generative models that recursively train on data generated by
previous generations. We quantify the sources of errors discussed in
the previous section by examining two mathematical models, which
prove to be simple enough to provide analytical expressions for quanti-
ties of interest, but also portray the phenomenon of model collapse:
a discrete distribution in the absence of functional expressivity and
approximation errors, and a multidimensional Gaussian approxima-
tion, portraying joint functional expressivity and statistical errors.
We further illustrate the impact of all three jointly for a more complex
setting of density estimation in Hilbert spaces in the Supplementary
Materials.

The overall stochastic process we consider, which we call learning
with generational data, is the following. The dataset at generation i is
iD , comprising independent and identically distributed random vari-
i  with distribution pi, j???{1,à,?Mi} denotes the size of the dataset.

to a mixing of data coming from the original distribution (?i), data used
by the previous generation (?i) and data generated by the new model
(?i). We refer to this as the sampling step. For the mathematical models
to come, we consider ?i?=??i?=?0, that is, data only from a single step are
used, whereas numerical experiments are performed on more realistic
choices of parameters.

Discrete distributions with exact approximation
In this subsection, we consider a discrete probability distribution in
absence of functional approximation and expressivity errors, that is,
F
. In this case, model collapse arises only because of statistical
errors from the sampling step. At first, the tails (low-probability events)
begin to disappear as a result of the low probability of sampling them
and, over time, support ofáthe distribution shrinks. Denoting the sam-
1 , the expected
ple size as M, if we consider state i with probability q ? M
number of samples with value i coming from those events will be less
than 1. In practice, this would mean that we lose information about
them. Considering more generally some state i with probability q, using
standard conditional probability, we can show that the probability of
losing information (that is, sampling no data at some generation) is
equal to 1???q, implying that the distribution must converge to a delta
function positioned at some state, with the probability of ending up
at a certain state equal to the probability of sampling said state from
the original distribution.

i

i

This can be shown directly by considering the process X F? ?
+1X  as a Markov chain, as Xi+1 only depends on Xi. Furthermore,
p ?i
+1
i  have the same value, then at the next generation, the approx-
if all the X j
imated distribution will be exactly a delta function and therefore all of
i+1 will also have the same value. This implies that the Markov chain
X j
contains at least one absorbing state and therefore, with probability
1, it will converge to one of the absorbing states. This is a well-known
fact, of which a proof is provided in the Supplementary Materials. For
this chain, the only absorbing states are those corresponding to delta
functions. As a result, as we follow the progress of model collapse, we
are guaranteed to end up in a constant state, having lost all the informa-
tion of the original distribution when the chain is absorbed. This argu-
ment also works in general owing to floating-point representations

being discrete, making the Markov chain over the parameters of the
model discrete. Thus, as long as the model parameterization allows
for delta functions, we will get to it, becauseùowing to sampling errorsù
the only possible absorbing states are delta functions. On the basis of
the discussion above, we see how both early model collapse, in which
only the low-probability events get cut off, and late stage model col-
lapse, in which the process begins to collapse into a single mode, must
arise in the case of discrete distributions with perfect functional
approximation.

Multidimensional Gaussian
Following the discussion about discrete distributions, we now present a
more generic result, which can be shown in the Gaussian approximation
setting, in which each generation is approximated using the unbiased
estimates of the mean and the variance. A similar result holds more
generally, which we detail in theáSupplementary Materials.

Theorem 3.1 (Gaussian model collapse). Assume the original data
are sampled from distribution  0D  (not necessarily Gaussian), with non-
zero sample variance. Assume Xn are fit recursively using the unbiased
sample mean and variance estimators from the previous generation,

in which W2 denotes the Wasserstein-2 distance between the true dis-
tribution and its approximation at generation n.

In words, this implies that not only does the nth generation approxi-
mation diverge arbitrarily far from the original one but it also collapses
to be zero variance as the number of generations increases, with prob-
ability 1. The results are very analogous to that seen in the discrete case,
with this theorem illustrating the effect of late stage model collapse, in
which the process begins to collapse to be zero variance. The early stage
model collapse can also be seen and the interested reader is referred to
theáSupplementary Materials for a more in-depth discussion.

Model collapse in language models
In this section, we evaluate the effect of model collapse on language
models. We cover more interpretable machine learning modelsùVAEs
and GMMsùin theáSupplementary Materials. Code is publically avail-
able in ref.?13.

Model collapse is universal across various families of machine learn-
ing models. Yet, if small models such as GMMs and VAEs are normally
trained from scratch, LLMs are different. They are so expensive to retrain
from scratch that they are typically initialized with pre-trained models
such as BERT4, RoBERTa5 or GPT-2 (ref.?2), which are trained on large
text corpora. They are then fine-tuned to various downstreamátasks14.
Here we explore what happens with language models when they
are sequentially fine-tuned with data generated by other models. We
can easily replicate all experiments covered in this paper with larger
language models in non-fine-tuning settings to demonstrate model
collapse. Given that training a single moderately large model produces
twice the American lifetimeÆs worth of CO2 (ref.?15), we opted to not run
such an experiment and instead focus on a more realistic setting for a
proof of concept. Note that even the language experiments described
in this paper took weeks to run. We evaluate the most common setting
of training a language modelùa fine-tuning setting for which each of
the training cycles starts from a pre-trained model with recent data. The
data here come from another fine-tuned pre-trained model. Because
training is restricted to produce models that are close to the original
pre-trained model, and data points generated by the models will gener-
ally produce very small gradients, the expectation here may be that the
model should only change moderately after fine-tuning. We fine-tune
the OPT-125m causal language model made available by Meta through
Hugging Face6.

We fine-tune it on the wikitext2 dataset16. For data generation from
the trained models, we use a five-way beam search. We block training
sequences to be 64 tokens long; then, for each token sequence in the
training set, we ask the model to predict the next 64 tokens. We go
through all of the original training dataset and produce an artificial
dataset of the same size. Because we go through all of the original
dataset and predict all of the blocks, if the model had 0 error, it would
produce the original wikitext2 dataset. Training for each generation
starts with generation from the original training data. Each experiment
is run five times and the results are shown as five separate runs with
different randomness seeds. The original model fine-tuned with real
wikitext2 data obtains 34 mean perplexity, from the zero-shot baseline
of 115, that is, it successfully learns the task. Finally, to be as realistic
as possible, we use the best-performing model on the original task,
evaluated using the original wikitext2 validation set, as the base model
for the subsequent generations, meaning thatùin practiceùobserved
model collapse can be even more pronounced. Here we consider two
different settings:
ò  Five epochs, no original training data. Here the model is trained for
five epochs starting on the original dataset but with no original data
retained for subsequent runs. The overall original task performance is
presented in Fig.á1b. We find that training with generated data allows
us to adapt to the underlying task, losing some performance, from
20 to 28 perplexity points.

ò  Ten epochs, 10% of original training data preserved. Here the model
is trained for ten epochs on the original dataset and with every new
generation of training, a random 10% of the original data points is
sampled. The overall original task performance is presented in Fig.á1c.
We find that preservation of the original data allows for better model
fine-tuning and leads to only minor degradation of performance.

Both training regimes lead to degraded performance in our models,
yet we do find that learning with generated data is possible and models
can successfully learn (some of) the underlying task. In particular, from
Fig.á1 and their 3D versions in theáSupplementary Materials, we see that
model collapse occurs, as the density of samples with low perplexity
begins to accumulate over the generations. This in turn makes it likely
that, over the generations, the sampled data will similarly collapse to
a delta function.

It is important to note here that the observed behaviour is in line with
the general intuition established in the section æTheoretical intuitionÆ. To
be precise, in all experiments, generational learning is only performed
on a finite (usually small) number of generations, whereas claims of
the section æTheoretical intuitionÆ are mostly presented in the limit of
generations going to infinity. However, as seen from experiments on
VAEs and GMMs in theáSupplementary Materials, convergence to delta
functions and specific rates of such convergence are highly related to
the specifics of the problem considered, and complete collapse may
or may not occur, even after a small number of steps. This is further
illustrated theoretically in theáSupplementary Materials, in which
potentially notable divergence from the original model can occur even
after a few generations.

Figureá1b,c on the left shows histograms of individual data-point
perplexities generated by the models of different generations as
is evaluated by the first model developed with real wikitext2 train-
ing data. Here, over the generations, models tend to produce more
sequences that the original model would produce with the higher
likelihood. The observed effect is similar to that described for VAEs
and GMMs in theáSupplementary Materials, in whichùover the genera-
tionsùmodels started to produce samples that would be produced
with higher probabilities by the original model. At the same time, we
discover that generated data have much longer tails, suggesting that
some of the data would never be produced by the original modelù
these are the errors that accumulate because of the learning with
generational data.

Innocent.

Ablation: Repetitions
We find that data generated by language models in our experiments
end up containing a large number of repeating phrases, as in Example 1.
The repeating problem has been observed in nearly all text-generation
models17,18 and, to rule this out as the cause of model collapse, we further
provide numerical experiments when models are explicitly encouraged
to produce non-repeating sequences with a repeating penalty of 2.0.
We find that this causes the models to produce lower score continua-
tions to avoid using repeats, whichùas a resultùcauses the consequent
models to perform even worse. Model perplexities shift across the
generations towards more probable token sequences, as measured
using the model trained on the original real data distribution. Further
illustrations are provided in theáSupplementary Materials. In particular,
enforcing this for the LLM experiments causes the perplexity to double
compared with the original. Models remain as susceptible to model
collapse, if not more.

The described process demonstrates that fine-tuning of language
models does not curb the effects of model collapse and models that
are being fine-tuned are also vulnerable. We find that, over the gen-
erations, models tend to produce more probable sequences from the
original data and start introducing their own improbable sequences,
that is, errors.

Discussion
We now discuss the implications of model collapse on the underlying
learning dynamics of LLMs. Long-term poisoning attacks on language
models are not new. For example, we saw the creation of click, content
and troll farms, a form of human ælanguage modelsÆ, whose job is to mis-
guide social networks and search algorithms. The negative effect that
these poisoning attacks had on search results led to changes in search
algorithms. For example, Google downgraded farmed articles19, putting
more emphasis on content produced by trustworthy sources, such as
education domains, whereas DuckDuckGo removed them altogether20.
What is different with the arrival of LLMs is the scale at which such
poisoning can happen once it is automated. Preserving the ability of

ArticleLLMs to model low-probability events is essential to the fairness of their
predictions: such events are often relevant to marginalized groups.
Low-probability events are also vital to understand complex systems21.
Our evaluation suggests a æfirst mover advantageÆ when it comes
to training models such as LLMs. In our work, we demonstrate that
training on samples from another generative model can induce
a distribution shift, whichùover timeùcauses model collapse. This in
turn causes the model to mis-perceive the underlying learning task.
To sustain learning over a long period of time, we need to make sure
that access to the original data source is preserved and that further
data not generated by LLMs remain available over time. The need to
distinguish data generated by LLMs from other data raises questions
about the provenance of content that is crawled from the Internet:
it is unclear how content generated by LLMs can be tracked at scale.
One option is community-wide coordination to ensure that different
parties involved in LLM creation and deployment share the informa-
tion needed to resolve questions of provenance. Otherwise, it may
become increasingly difficult to train newer versions of LLMs without
access to data that were crawled from the Internet before the mass
adoption of the technology or direct access to data generated by
humans at scale.
